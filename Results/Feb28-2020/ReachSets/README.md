## Description

This plots compares the reachable set of the uncertain system with the un-perturbed system using the _Splitting Method_

* The Blue (circle) plots show the reachable set of the unperturbed system
* The Red (plus) plots the reachable set of the previous step of the perturbed system
* The Black (cross) plots the reachable set of the perturbed system at this step. _I.e._ The Red part plus U (The effect of the perturbation)

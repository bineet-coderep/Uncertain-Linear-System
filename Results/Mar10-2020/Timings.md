## Time Taken 

This is the time taken for individual benchmarks to just compute the over-approximate reachable set. No visualization or comparison (with other reach sets) is performed along with this.

Following are the timing:

* **`Stable System 1 (3 Dim)`:** 10 min 51 sec.
* **`Stable System 2  (2 Dim):`** 6 min 39 sec.
* **`Stable System 3 (2 Dim):`** 6 min  31 sec.
* **`Stable System 4 (3 Dim):`** 13 min 18 sec.
* **`Flight Envelope (16 Dim):`** 4 hr 39 min 7 sec.
* **`PKPD (5 Dim)`:** 35 min 27 sec.
* **`Spacecraft Rendezvous (6 Dim)`: **  52 min 13 sec.
* **`Co Op Vehicles (10 Dim):`** 2 hr 18 min 37 sec
* **`DC-DC Converter (3 Dim):`** 12 min 50 sec.
* **`Holes (10 Dim):`** 3 hrs 0 min 28 sec.
* **`Motor Transmission I (7 Dim):`** 37 min 32 sec.
* **`Motor Transmission II (5 Dim):`**  21 min 9 sec.

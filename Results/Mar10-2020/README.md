## Description

This plots compares the reachable set of the uncertain system with the un-perturbed system using the _Splitting Method_

* The Blue plot shows the reachable set of the unperturbed system
* The Red plots the reachable set of the previous step of the perturbed system
* The Black plots the reachable set of the perturbed system at this step. _I.e._ The Red part plus U (The effect of the perturbation)
* The Magenta plots the reachable sets of the random samples from the perturbed matrix.
* The Cyan plots the effect of changing the predicates while computing U, at each interval of time.
